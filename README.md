# Openset-Face-Verification


This project is still in progress and will be updated after finishing the remaining part 

Things to be done:
  1./ Create the HRNet model and train it
  2./ write code for alert system
  3./ create the embsd.json file
  4./ Making the whole code cleaner and more inderstandable
  5./ Potential improvements for 
        i.  composite loss function (cosine sim + euclidean dist)
        ii. Using HRNet
        iii. Better finetuning methods (Hyperparameter tuning)
        iv. Potential improvement in comparision of embeddings
