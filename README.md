# Openset-Face-Verification


This project is still in progress and will be updated after finishing the remaining part 

Things to be done:
  1. Create the HRNet model and train it
  2. write code for alert system
  3. create the embsd.json file
  4. Making the whole code cleaner and more inderstandable
  5. Potential improvements for 
        * composite loss function (cosine sim + euclidean dist)
        * Using HRNet
        * Better finetuning methods (Hyperparameter tuning)
        * Potential improvement in comparision of embeddings
